# MPAS-Project

Mentor Program Administration System (UCT Computer Science project)

MPAS is one of the final year projects that the Computer Science department at the University of Cape Town delegated to its students. The aim of the system to be able to facilitate a mentorship programme between third year computer science mentors and first year computer science students. The system has 3 types of users - administration, mentors, and students (or mentees). A mentee can sign up to the system, look at all of the available times the mentors are available (that all include the time, venue, seats available, etc.), and it allows the mentee to provide feedback regarding the meetings. Similarly, a mentor can log into the system, set up meeting dates and venues, and give feedback about the meeting sessions and individual mentees. The administrator can add users as either mentors or mentees, and has full access to all of the aspects of the system (except editing feedback)
